# 1st project
## [Top 100 movies on Netflix: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/paukat/Python-projects/blob/main/Netflix%20top%20movies%20analysis.ipynb)

### Abstract
"Top 100 movies on Netflix: Exploratory Data Analysis" project analyses top 100 movies on Netflix in different perspectives. It provides insights that even though the most watchable movies are the latest ones, the release year does not guarantee the highest score. Also, from critics perspective, story, performance and cast are the most important aspects for the acceptance of a movie. It is worth to mention that the most often director in this dataset is Peter Jackson with all three parts of "The Lord of the Rings".

# 2nd project
## [Coronary heart disease (CHD) prediction using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/paukat/Python-projects/blob/main/Coronary%20heart%20disease%20(CHD)%20prediction%20using%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

### Abstract
The "Framingham" heart disease dataset includes 4240 rows and 16 features. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease. I have created a model using logistic regression and estimated predictions. Furthermore, the model was assessed with performance metrics.
