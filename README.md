## Top 100 movies on Netflix: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Abstract
"Top 100 movies on Netflix: Exploratory Data Analysis" project analyses top 100 movies on Netflix in different perspectives. It provides insights that even though the most watchable movies are the latest ones, the release year does not guarantee the highest score. Also, from critics perspective, story, performance and cast are the most important aspects for the acceptance of a movie. It is worth to mention that the most often director in this dataset is Peter Jackson with all three parts of "The Lord of the Rings".
